# UCAR Internships Professional Development Workshop Series

</div>

## Workshop 6: Data Management & Visualization
In this session of the UCAR Internship PDWS, we will show you how problem solving with data
can be an exciting first step in any scientific journey you might embark on.
Once that journey has begun, we can then wrap it up with some tips and resources for making
poster-ready visualization to share with your scientific audience!

## :cloud: Using [Science Gateway](http://scigw.unidata.ucar.edu/)
If you've registered for this workshop, you will do all of this work on our very own _gateway_ to the NSF Jetstream Cloud!
For this course, your GitHub username will serve as registration for these resources.

When you first sign in, it may take a few seconds for your personal workspace to populate and your coding environment to be fully set up.
From here you will discover a Jupyter Lab interface pre-populated with these materials and a few tools to enable you to update the materials if needed.

This requires only a web browser and a stable internet connection.
Get to coding!
